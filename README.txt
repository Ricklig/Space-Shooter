Normal Mode – In this version, the basic version of the game is implemented as below. The game
ends when the player dies, or when you beat the Boss at the end of the level.

Bullet Hell Mode – This game is a variation of the game descripbed below. In this game mode,
bullets not touching an enemy will wrap around the screen for up to 3 times. If a bullet reaches
the top of the screen, it will re-appear at the bottom of the screen. If it reaches the left side, it will
re-appear on the right side (similar to the game Asteroids). This makes the game more difficult
because the player can be hit by its own bullets

feedback (audio, particle effects) for every important action in the
game (being hit, picking up a power up, defeating an enemy, hitting boss targets, destroying boss, dying).
Audio cues have not been places on shot firing because too much noise with multiple shots. 

Completed deliverable with all required aspects of assignment. 

Thank you,
